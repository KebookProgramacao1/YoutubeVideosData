# YoutubeVideosData

I recently had a need to extract data from youtube playlists, but I didn't own the playlist, so youtube API didn't fit me, this code is meant to help people in this situation

Attention:
1 - It is currently not possible to collect data from age-restricted videos, or marked as inappropriate content.
2 - the results are still slow, in the future i plan to replace everything that uses the pafy library with bs4, because it is faster
